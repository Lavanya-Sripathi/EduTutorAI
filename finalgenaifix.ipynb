            "GPT  or generative pre trained transformer is a  large language model or an LLM that can \n",
            "generate  human like text and I've been using GPT  in its  various forms for years . In this video , \n",
            "we are going to number one , ask what is an LLM ? Number  two, we are going to describe how \n",
            "they work . And then number three , we're going to  ask what are  the business applications of \n",
            "LLMs.  \n",
            " \n",
            "So let's start with number one , what is a large  language model . Well, a large language model  is \n",
            "an instance of something else , called a  foundation model . Now , foundation models are pre \n",
            "trained on large amounts of  unlabeled and self-supervised  data, meaning the model learns \n",
            "from  patterns in the data in the way that produces  generalizable  and adaptable output . \n",
            " \n",
            "And large language models are instances of foundation models  applied specifically to text  and \n",
            "text like things . I'm talking about things  \n",
            "like code . Now,  large language models are trained on  large data sets of text such  as books , \n",
            "articles , and conversations  and look when we say large these models can be  tens of gigabytes  \n",
            "in size and trained on enormous amounts of  text data . We're talking potentially  petabyte s of \n",
            "data here . So to put that into perspective , a text file that is let's say one gigabyte  in size , that \n",
            "can store about one hundred  and seventy eight million  words . A lot of words just in one GB. \n",
            "And how many gigabyte s are in a petabyte ? Well, it's about one million yet that's truly a lot of \n",
            "text.  \n",
            " \n",
            "LLS are also among the  biggest models when it comes to parameter  count.  A parameter  is a \n",
            "value the model can change independently.  \n",
            "as it learns and the more parameters a model has the more complex  it can be . GPT-3 for \n",
            "example is  pre trained on a corpus of actually forty -five terabytes  of data and it uses a hundred  \n",
            "and seventy -five billion LLM  parameters .  \n",
            " \n",
            "All right , so how do they work ? Well, we can think of it like this . LLM  equals three things  – data , \n",
            "architecture, and lastly , we can think of it  as training . Those three things  are really the \n",
            "components of an LLM.  Now, we've already discussed the enormous amounts of  text data that \n",
            "goes into these things . As for the architecture , this is a neural network  and for  GPT, that is a \n",
            "tran sformer.  \n",
            " \n",
            "And the transformer architecture enables the model to handl e sequences of data like \n",
            "sentences or lines of code , and transformers are designed to understand the  context of each \n",
            "word in a sentence by considering it  \n",
            "   \n",
            "Page 2 of 3 \n",
            " \n",
            "in relation to every other word . This allows the model to build a  comprehensive understanding \n",
            "of the sentence structure  and the meaning of the words within it . And then this architecture is \n",
            "trained on  all of this large amount of data . During training , the model learns  to predict  the next \n",
            "word in a sentence . So, “the sky is ” it starts off with a random  guess . “The sky is bug ”. But with \n",
            "each iteration , the model adjusts its internal parameters  to reduce the difference between its \n",
            "predictions  and the actual outcomes . And the model keeps doing this gradually improving its \n",
            "word  predictions until it can reliably generate  coherent sentences . Forget about  “bug”, it can \n",
            "figure out its “blue ”.  \n",
            " \n",
            "Now,  the model can be fine-tuned  on a  smaller more specific data set . Here the model  refines \n",
            "its understanding to be  able to perform this specific task more accurately . Fine tuning  is what \n",
            "allows a general language model  to become an expert at a specific task .  \n",
            " \n",
            "Okay, so how does this all fit in to number three , business applications ? Well, for customer \n",
            "service applications , businesses can  \n",
            "use LLMs  to create intelligent chat bots that can a variety of customer queries freeing up  human \n",
            "agents for more complex issues . \n",
            " \n",
            "Another good field is content creation . That can benefit from LLMs  which can help  generate \n",
            "articles , emails , social media posts, and  even YouTube  video scripts . Hm, there's an idea now .  \n",
            " \n",
            "LLMs  can even contribute to  software development,  and they can do that by  helping to \n",
            "generate and review code . And  that's just scratching  the surface . As large language models \n",
